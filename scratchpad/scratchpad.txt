/register -> pass as candidate param
/login -> Username and password

(Websocket)
/live-feed -> to get the current results for all the candidates
/vote -> a session to vote, after user passes a vote, user is logged out

*PS* Make sure that a user has only voted once, don't let user to start new session if already logged in.
*PS* Keeping a record of who voted for whom is probably wrong, so let's not keep that data.

DB -> Redis

Table Schema
User Table => Username (unique), password (string), isStandingForElection (bool), hasVoted (bool)
Votes Table => UserName (unique), noOfVotes (int)

Conditions to take care:-
1. Make sure that a user has only voted once
2. Make sure that while voting, that user isStandingForElection.

So,
1. One hashset per user
2. A set of usernames to make sure that only one exist.
3. A set of users that can be standing for elections
4. Sorted set for all the users standing in the election with the vote count
